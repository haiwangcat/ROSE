// This old method of using hard-coded register numbers, although fast, has some problems.  Two big ones are that it doesn't
// allow a software layer (SymbolicSemantics::State) to safely and easily implement a subset of all available registers, and it
// isn't able to easily describe parts of registers (like the x86 OF flag vs. the entire EFLAGS register, or EIP vs. RIP, etc.)

#elif 1

// ROSE is moving toward a more dynamic way of referring to registers.  See the doxygen documentation for the
// RegisterDictionary and RegisterDescriptor classes.  All recently implemented policies have a findRegister() method that
// returns a register descriptor (or an exception).  For SymbolicSemantics::State you'd have to know that it uses the register
// major number as an array index.  You could also cache the major number since it shouldn't change for the life of the
// SymbolicSemantics::Policy<> object.

// If you're not copying states around and just need the value of a register in the policy's current state, you can use this
// code.  There's also a faster version that takes a register descriptor.
