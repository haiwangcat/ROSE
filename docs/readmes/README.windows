CMake is now checked in by Andreas, so we can play with it building ROSE using CMake
under both Linux and Windows.


For Windows:
To run rdesktop from my Linux machine:
     wxp -g 5 -s tux245-0
or
     rdesktop -g 1600x1200 tux270-0

*** NOTE: if running in fullscreen mode use "CTRL-ALT-ENTER" to get out.



Check out a new version of ROSE from SVN (on our tux245-0 system this is in:
/cygdrive/c/ROSE/svn-rose)


Run Cmake GUI (from Start Menu).
   We are using CMake 2.6 Patch 4.
   1) Specify the source code location ("where is the source code?")
   2) Specify the location of the build tree ("Where to build the binaries?")
   3) * Optional: There are different views (Simple, Advance, and Grouped)
   4) Click "Configure" button.
   5) The install directory needs to be setup (click on "...")
   6) Click "Configure" button.
   7) Click "Generate" button (which will appear after "configure" passes).

Current problems:
   1) First error: The top level ROSE/CMakeLists.txt file has some things that
      will need to be commented out (languages (fortran), and a few libraries (m_lib,
      rt_lib))

   8) After passing ("Generating done"), close CMake GUI. 

   9) In "Explorer" (or any file tool), enter the compile tree directory
      and click on "Project.sln" to start the MS Visual Studio ROSE project.



For new windows server tux270-0:
   rdesktop tux270-0
or
   rdesktop -g 1600x1200 tux270-0
<click other users>
<enter login and password: e.g. "the-lab\quinlan1" and "PAC".

What is needed to use ROSE is in the C:ROSE directory.

Run git-bash (click on icon on left)

To see how to build a git clone:
cat ../ROSE-tps/ROSE-git/.git/config

git clone ssh://dquinlan@tux282.llnl.gov/nfs/casc/overture/ROSE/git/ROSE.git


Setting up SSH keys on Windows Server (logged in as hudson-rose):
NOTE: Important is that is is done for CMD (not for git-bash or cygwin, etc.)
More information about this is at: http://devlicio.us/blogs/sergio_pereira/archive/2009/05/06/git-ssh-putty-github-unfuddle-the-kitchen-sink.aspx

A. Generate the keys:
   1) Generate the keys, run "plink -agent tux269" and enter your
      own login and then password. to login to tux269 and then exit.

B. Copy the keys onto tux270-0:
   1) Double Click on "My_Computer" icon
   2) Goto C:, tools, pageant.exe
   3) Double click on pageant.exe
   4) Should display a computer with a hat on it in the bottom right corner of the screen.
   5) Right click on icon (of computer with a hat on it)
   6) click on "Add Key" (this will cause a window to put up called "Select Private Key File"
   7) Goto "My Computer TUX270-0", "Local Disk(C:)", "putty_keys"
   8) Click on file "id_rsa.ppk"  (this will load the private  key for use by ssh).
   9) Now try to run the git command:
         git clone ssh://hudson-rose@tux269/nfs/casc/overture/ROSE/git/ROSE.git c:\ROSE\hudson\workspace\test-windows\label\windows-server
      and
         git clone ssh://hudson-rose@tux269/nfs/casc/overture/ROSE/git/ROSE-EDG.git c:\ROSE\hudson\workspace\test-windows\label\windows-server\src\frontend\CxxFrontend\EDG
      And it should work.

  10) (moved to part A-1 above) If not then it might be because we ran "plink -agent tux269"
     and entered the login "hudson-rose" and then the password,
     to login to tux269, and then exited.


For Linux:
Command to run cmake to build ROSE:
     cmake /home/dquinlan/ROSE/svn-rose -DBOOST_ROOT=/home/dquinlan/local/boost_1_37_0.gxx-4.2.4
  OR
     cmake /home/dquinlan/ROSE/git-rose-windows -DBOOST_ROOT=/home/dquinlan/local/boost_1_37_0.gxx-4.2.4

Note that CMake will compile ROSE dramatically faster.  The reasons seem to be:
   1) it is able to extract greater parallelism in the build process
   2) it does not use libtool


Brief writeup fron John:
Hi Dan,
   Here is a quick hit and I will fill it in with pictures next week:
The key software that is needed to get it to work is called pageant.exe. To start this up
navigate to c:\tools and double click on pageant.exe.  That will put a little icon in
the system tray in the lower right hand corner which looks like a terminal with a
black hat on it.  Once that is running, right click on it and select Èadd KeyÉ  That
will pop up a  window and most likely it will already be at the point you need but if
it is not, navigate to c:\putty_keys and select Èid_rsa.ppkÉ and that should allow you
to use git from the command line.

So for a quick reference:
   Pageant.exe located at c:\tools

Id_rsa.ppk located at c:\putty_keys
