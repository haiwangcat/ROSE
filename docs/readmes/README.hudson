README for the new Hudson support in ROSE (Continuous Integration)
 
##########  WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED ABOUT WORKING WITH HUDSON #############

1. If Hudson fails right away (like the "too many open files" error)
then it won't show a name for the branch.

2. If Hudson fails before it starts running the test script (like above,
or if it can't cleanly merge "master" into the to-be-tested branch) then
it will retest that branch if you click "Build Now" or restart Hudson.

3. If Hudson can't merge master into the branch to be tested it's
because the "master" branch has advanced to the point that there are
merge conflicts.

4. How to cancel a hudson job: 
   First, the "x" next to the job in the "Build History" list does not work.  However,
if you go to the "Hudson" web page (http://tux269.llnl.gov:8080) instead of the
ROSE-matrix web page (http://tux269.llnl.gov:8080/job/ROSE-matrix/); then
you can click on the link (something line "Building ROSE-matrix #xxx)
and if you click on the "x" there is will quickly cancel the job (first it
cancels the pending builds in the "Build Queue" and then it will
(after a few seconds) cancel the currently running jobs.

Commands used one to setup and maintain GIT and not used by users afterward:
   Command to use git-svn support (checkes out a git-based SVN repository):
      git svn clone file:///nfs/casc/overture/ROSE/svn/ROSE/trunk/ROSE ROSE

   To update git repository from SVN use (from in the git repository):
      git svn fetch


################# Maintaining Hudson ###################

How to reboot Hudson after (if not setup properly in crontab)
   1) start Hudson: "screen -d -m ./startHudsonMaster
   2) Detach screen: "CTRL-a d"

New Web Server Support:
   http://tux269.llnl.gov:8080/job/ROSE/

Previous directions before web server support:
   How to logon to the tux269 machine:
      ssh -X -L 8080:localhost:8080 tux269

   How to bring up the hudson web page:
      firefox http://localhost:8080/job/ROSE/ &

How to reproduce bugs that Hudson finds:

   1) Find the failed test within the Husdon web pages.
      Check the build log to see what machine was used to do the build.
   2) ssh to the correct machine using the "hudson-rose" account.
   3) Source the file to setup the environment variables.
      "source ~/startHudson-common"
   4) Using the commands from the runScript (found in scripts/hudson)
      issue any of al of the commands in the order specified in the runScript.
      For example, run the edg specific commands if that was the part that failed.



Setting up Hudson:
   1) Download from: http://hudson-ci.org/

   2) Install using:
      cd /home/dquinlan/local/hudson-1.336/ && screen -d -m java -jar /home/dquinlan/local/hudson-1.336/hudson.war --httpListenAddress=127.0.0.1"
      where "/home/dquinlan/local/hudson-1.336/" is an example location for the
      "hudson.war" file.
      Note that this starts husdon in a screen and detaches. Type "screen -r" to visit the
      screen, and ^ad to exit the screen.  At this point hudson is running in the
      background.

   3) To see Hudson run, point your browser to: "http://localhost:8080"

   4) Add git plugin if you want to run Hudson with git.
      Note that you have to click the button to restart Hudson, but it will
      restart itself automatically.

   5) Add a job, define a user (yourself), and setup the email and 
      logation of git repository, etc.

   6) Click "ENABLE AUTOREFRESH" (top right corner of window).

   7) Add a machine to use for running jobs.
      If the machine is taken off line, reset this by disabling the 
      6 or so reason why hudson will take a machine offline (diskspace,
      and other resource limitations) and then reset the build executor.

   x) Setup your crontab to restart hudson if your machine is rebooted.
      "@reboot cd /home/dquinlan/local/hudson-1.336/ && screen -d -m java -jar /home/dquinlan/local/hudson-1.336/hudson.war --httpListenAddress=127.0.0.1"

Additional setup issues for Hudson, configuration:
* smtp server: smtp.llnl.gov
* Enable security Access Control,  Security Realm: Hudson's own user database, Allow users to sign up,  Authorization: Matrix-based security 

How to setup slave machines:

copy the required files from an example node:
-bash-3.00$ pwd 
/export
-bash-3.00$ ls -al
total 36
drwxr-xr-x   5 root        root  4096 Dec 14 09:59 .
drwxr-xr-x  27 root        root  4096 Dec 10 09:06 ..
drwx------   2 root        root 16384 Oct 16  2008 lost+found
drwxr-xr-x   4 root        root  4096 Nov 13 14:34 old
drwxr-xr-x   3 hudson-rose rose  4096 Dec 14 12:40 tmp.hudson-rose
-bash-3.00$ rsync -av --delete tux283:/export/tmp.hudson-rose .

This should setup the /export/tmp.hudson-rose directory.

Better is to run from the /export directory: "rsync -av tux282:/export/tmp.hudson-rose ."
And likely we only really need the "opt" directory where all the compilers are located.



*****************************
Hudson Windows Server Support
*****************************

  Different from the Linux machines where the slaves can be started from the
Hudsom web page on tux269:8080, the Windows tux270-0 slave must
be started by logging into tux270-0 and using the web page from
explorer and starting launching the slave service (on tux270-0) directly.
this is one of the ways that Hudson is handled differently on Windows
than on Linux.


**************************
Our Hudson setup on tux269
**************************

Hudson builds a list of branches against which to test.  This is done
by running get fetch (I think) on the directory located on tux283. The
directory is: /export/tmp.hudson-rose/hudson/workspace/ROSE-matrix

A currently problem is that it seems that Hudson is cycling through the
branches and testing each one.  The branches are a set larger than what is
in our main GIT repository in /nfs/casc, and it has bee identified
to be the branches that are in tux283:/export/tmp.hudson-rose/hudson/workspace/ROSE-matrix
This repository is being backed up and pruned to represent the smaller
number of branches our main GIT repository in /nfs/casc.

Note from Andreas:
   If you ever run into this problem again, go into that directory 
(tux283:/export/tmp.hudson-rose/hudson/workspace/ROSE-matrix) and type
"git remote prune origin"
