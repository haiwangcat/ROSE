This page contains some of the research papers associated with the
ROSE project over the last several years.  For numerous reasons, we feel
that the latest papers are the best papers, this is likely typical
of any ambitious project; but we have included everything for
completeness.  It is hoped that the underlying goal within each paper
of supporting the use of high-level abstractions will be clear together with
our attempts to address the performance issues required for the use of
high-level abstractions within scientific computing.

\section Label12 2012
- Hongyi Ma, Qichang Chen, and Liqiang Wang, Chunhua Liao and Daniel Quinlan,
"OpenMP-Checker: Detecting Concurrency Errors of OpenMP Programs Using Hybrid Program Analysis",
submitted to ICPP'12, The 41st International Conference on Parallel Processing, Pittsburgh, PA, September 10-13, 2012.
	<br/><br/>
	<i>
	This paper presents a novel technique to detect data races and deadlocks of OpenMP programs, using hybrid program analysis. Specifically, we use an
	SMT-solver based static analysis to analyze
	OpenMP source code. Then we use a dynamic analysis to confirm, or rule out, the potential errors. The static analysis narrows down the code regions and
	events that need to be monitored, significantly reducing the overhead of the dynamic analysis. Our experiments show that OpenMP-Checker is more scalable and accurate
	at pinpointing concurrency errors within a set of chosen benchmarks, compared to the two commercial tools, Sun Thread Analyzer and Intel Thread Checker.

"ROSE::FTTransform â€“ A Source-to-Source Translation Framework for Exascale Fault-Tolerance Research",
submitted to Fault-Tolerance for HPC at Extreme Scale (FTXS 2012), Boston, June 25-28, 2012.
	<br/><br/>
	<i>
	This paper presents a compiler based transformation released in ROSE and demonstrates 
	the use of Triple Modular Redundancy as an approach to provide HPC software with fault tolerance against 
	transient faults, as we expect them to manifest themselves on future Exascale architectures.  The paper presents
	performance results showing that for a randomly selected subset of benchmarks the overhead of this extra
	layer of support is about 20%.  We expect that may be competitive with future approaches to fault tolerance
	using check-point restart that may be much more expensive or maybe even intractable for Exascale.  This work is
	released as a framework within ROSE to support research work in this area by ourselves and collaborators.

"Auto-scoping for OpenMP tasks",
accepted by the 8th International Workshop on OpenMP, IWOMP 2012, Rome, June 11-13, 2012.
	<br/><br/>
	<i>	
	This paper presents an auto-scoping algorithm to work with OpenMP tasks. (Auto-scoping is the process of automatically determining the data sharing dependencies
	of variables in OpenMP programs). This is a much more complex challenge due to the uncertainty of when a task
	will be executed, which makes it harder to determine what parts of the program will run concurrently. We also introduce an implementation of the algorithm and
	results with several benchmarks showing that the algorithm is able to correctly scope a large percentage of the variables appearing in them.

"Studying The Impact Of Application-level Optimizations On The Power Consumption Of Multi-Core Architectures",
accepted by <a href="http://www.computingfrontiers.org/2012">The ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers 2012 (CF'12)</a>, May 15th-17th, 2012, Cagliari, Italy.
	<br/><br/>
	<i>
	This paper presents an extensive study of the impact of application level optimizations on both the performance and power efficiencies of applications from a wide range
	of scientific and embedded systems domains. We observe that application-level optimizations often have a much larger impact on performance than on power consumption. However,
	optimizing for performance does not necessarily lead to better power consumption, and vice versa. Compared to sequential applications, multithreaded applications give more
	room for performance and power improvements. Additionally, a number of optimizations, including loop and thread affinity optimizations, have shown great potential in
	supporting collective enhancement of both performance and power efficiency. Our experimental results provide several insights to help exploit these optimizations effectively.

<a href="../ROSE_ResearchPapers/2009-SourceToSourceOutliningToSupportWholeProgramEmpiricalOptimization-LCPC.pdf"> pdf </a>. \n
 This paper describes our work of using ROSE to build an effective source-to-source outliner in order to support whole program
 empirical optimization (also called autotuning). The ROSE outliner addresses the problem of extracting tunable
 kernels out of large scale applications, thereby helping to convert the challenging whole-program tuning problem into a set of
 more manageable kernel tuning tasks. In particular, the outliner can generate kernels which preserve performance characteristics
 of tuning targets which can be easily handled by other tools. This work also demonstrates how one can use ROSE's compiler analyses to enhance the quality of source-to-source translation.

     This paper outlines an approach to the optimization of user-defined abstractions.
     This work represents a substantial goal for ROSE and an initial work by us on the
     general subject of how to write code at a very high level of abstraction and have the
     lower level code required to get good performance be automatically generated.
     This paper covers the details of optimizing object-oriented abstractions using ROSE.

     Discusses the different approaches to the
     optimization of array class libraries.  Optimization of array class libraries led
     to the development of ROSE as a project, though ROSE is not at all specific to array
     class libraries and addresses the optimization of libraries generally.  This paper
     can be helpful in understanding what work was done using language template
     features within C++ before attempting to address the optimization issues more
     generally at compile time. Prior work started on ROSE had been abandoned because
     of the perceived significant advantages of template meta-programming techniques
     for scientific computing.  Several papers on the details of template use were
     written, this is the most complete of them.  It is included with these papers to
     provide a bit of perspective (currently historical).
