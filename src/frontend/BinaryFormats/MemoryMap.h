/** An efficient mapping from an address space to stored data.
 *
 *  This class maps addresses in a 64-bit virtual address space to data stored in buffers.  The address space is segmented into
 *  non-overlapping, contiguous regions called "segments" (see MemoryMap::Segment) and the addresses in a segment are mapped
 *  1:1 onto data storage containers (see MemoryMap::Buffer).  A MemoryMap stores pairs of address ranges and segments, and
 *  each Segment points to a Buffer.
 *
 *  Buffers come in a variety of kinds, all derived from MemoryMap::Buffer, and they are reference counted via Boost smart
 *  pointers.  Always refer to a buffer with the MemoryMap::BufferPtr type. They should be created with various create() class
 *  methods, and they should never be explicitly freed.
 *
 *  Here's an example of mapping a file into an address space at virtual address 0x08040000 and then temporarily replacing the
 *  second 8k page of the file with our own data.  We demonstrate using an MmapBuffer because these are very fast for large
 *  files, especially if only small parts of the file are accessed.  We could have also used
 *  MemoryMap::ByteBuffer::create_from_file(), but this copies the entire file contents into a heap-allocated buffer, which is
 *  slower.
 *
 * @code
 *  // Create and initialize the overlay data
 *  my_data_size = 8192;
 *  uint8_t *my_data = new uint8_t[my_data_size];
 *  initialize(my_data, my_data_size);
 *
 *  // Create the two buffers: one for the file, one for the overlay data
 *  MemoryMap::BufferPtr file_buf = MemoryMap::MmapBuffer("the_file", O_RDONLY, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE);
 *  MemoryMap::BufferPtr data_buf = MemoryMap::ByteBuffer(my_data, my_data_size);
 *  my_data = NULL; // it is now owned by data_buf and will be deleted automatically
 *
 *  // Create the memory map.
 *  MemoryMap map;
 *  map.insert(Extent(0x08040000, file_buf->size()),
 *             MemoryMap::Segment(file_buf, 0, MemoryMap::MM_PROT_READ, "the file contents"));
 *  map.insert(Extent(0x08042000, data_buf->size()),
 *             MemoryMap::Segment(data_buf, 0, MemoryMap::MM_PROT_RW, "data overlay"));
 * @endcode
 *
 *  A MemoryMap provides methods to easily read from and write to the underlying data storage, addressing it in terms of the
 *  virtual address space.  These functions return the number of bytes copied.
 *
 * @code
 *  // read part of the data, right across the file/overlay boundary
 *  uint8_t data[4096];
 *  size_t nread = map.read(data, 0x0804ff00, sizeof data);
 *  assert(nread==sizeof data);
 * @endcode
 *
 *  A MemoryMap is built on top of a RangeMap<Extent,Segment> and the map is available with via the segments() method.
 *  Therefore, all the usual RangeMap operations are available.  For instance, here's one way to determine if there's a large
 *  free area at 0xc0000000:
 *
 * @code
 *  // The set of addresses that are unmapped
 *  ExtentMap free_areas = map.segments().invert<ExtentMap>();
 *  bool b = free_areas.contains(Extent(0xc0000000,0x20000000));
 * @endcode
