 *  89c9                 mov ecx,ecx            move a register to itself...  The second byte of these are mod/rm
 *  89d2                 mov edx,edx            bytes, and can generally be substituded wherever you see 0xc0 in

 *  6689c0               mov ax,ax              and with an operand size prefix (0x66).
 *
 *  66666689c0           mov ax,ax              The prefixes can be repeated. One source seemed to imply that up to
 *                                              three are reliably supported by the actual Intel processors. ROSE supports

 *
 *  8ac0                 mov al,al              These are also presumabely no-ops.  As with most instructions, these will
 *  8bc0                 mov eax,eax            accept operand size prefixes as well.
 *
 *  f090                 lock nop               Most of these instructions will accept a lock prefix as well, which does
 *  f0f090               lock nop               not materially affect the result. As before, they can occur repeatedly, and
 *  f066f090             lock nop               even in wacky combinations.

 *  
 *  f290                 repne nop              Cory Cohen strongly suspects that the other instruction prefixes are

 *  2690                 es nop                 tests into the behavior of common processors.

/** Determines whether a sequence of instructions has an effect besides advancing the flow of control.
 *
 *  The specified list of instructions should be (part of) a basic block and the instructions are given in the order they would
 *  be executed. This function does not check that the instructions are actualy executed sequentially as specified, it just
 *  evaluates the machine state as if they had been executed sequentially.  This can be useful when a basic block was built
 *  from control-flow information that is not available to this function.
 *
 *  An empty sequence of instructions has no effect (i.e., return value is false).
 *
 *  If the final instruction of the sequence results in an undetermined instruction pointer then the sequence is considered to
 *  have an effect (this situation usually results from a conditional jump).  If the final instruction results in a known
 *  value for the instruction pointer, and the known value is the fall-through address then the final instruction is
 *  considered to have no effect.  If the final instruction results in a known instruction pointer that is not the
 *  fall-through address then the final instruction has an effect only if allow_branch is false.
 *
 *  If relax_stack_semantics is true then each time the stack pointer is increased the memory locations below
 *  the new stack value are discarded.  Typically, well behaved programs do not read stack data that is below the stack
 *  pointer.
 *
 *  "this" is only used to select the virtual function; the operation is performed on the specified instruction vector.
