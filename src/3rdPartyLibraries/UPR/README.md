==============================

Author: Tristan Vanderbruggen
Date:   Summer 2012

Object oriented runtime for in-node parallelism (OpenCL, CUDA, OpenMP, ...),
conceive to make code generation easier (modular) in automatic and/or guided
parallelisation in ROSE Compiler.

## Installation

TODO: it should be install along ROSE.

### Dependencies for Model Dependent Runtime (OpenCL, CUDA, OpenMP, ...)

TODO

## Usage

## Status

* Most design done
* OpenCL version is close to be working
