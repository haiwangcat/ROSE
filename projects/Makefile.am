# Add Projects that are associated with capabilities that belong to ROSE here. Or better yet, just add a "rose.config" file to
# your project directory and then you don't have to change any of the ROSE build system -- your project will be found
# automatically by the "build" script, your rose.config will be incorporated into the configuration system, and your project
# will become part of the recursive "make" commands.   To disable your project, just rename its rose.config file and rerun
# "build" and "configure". [RPM 2012-03-29]
