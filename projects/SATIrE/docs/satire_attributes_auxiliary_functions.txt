This file lists all CFG attributes, types, and auxiliary functions
accessible from PAG analysis specifications when using the SATIrE system.
Declarations for all of these features are provided by SATIrE; the user need
not repeat these declarations.


CFG Attributes
==============
A CFG attribute is accessible from the analysis specification by name,
essentially like a variable that may have different values in different
places. See Chapter 12 of the PAG manual for details on the general concept.
The attributes are presented in a way that is similar to the syntax used in
the .optla file.

GLOBAL Attributes
-----------------
globals: *VariableSymbolNT #
    A list of the global variables in the program. Types and initializers of
    global variables can be accessed via auxiliary functions, see below.

numtypes: unum #
    The number of different data types in the program. Types are associated
    with unique numbers that can be manipulated using auxiliary functions,
    see below.

numexprs: unum #
    The number of lexically different expressions in the program. Each
    expression is associated with a unique integer that can be manipulated
    using auxiliary functions, see below.

ROUTINE Attributes
------------------
procnum: snum #
    A unique numerical identifier for the current procedure. Procedure
    numbers are never negative.

BLOCK Attributes
----------------
label: snum #
    A unique numerical label for the block; as each block in SATIrE consists
    of exactly one statement, this can also be considered a unique label for
    each statement. Labels are never negative.

POSITION Attributes
-------------------
position: snum #
    A numerical label for what PAG calls the "position" of the analysis
    information: The pair (procnum, position) is a unique (opaque)
    identifier for the interprocedural analysis context at the current point
    in the analysis.

context: ContextInfo #
    A ContextInfo object identifying the current interprocedural analysis
    context.


SATIrE Types
============
SATIrE defines a number of data types that can be used in PAG analysis
specifications. In contrast to the AST types defined in the syn file, the
types listed here behave more like built-in PAG types. In particular, they
can be used in the analyzer's carrier type.
The following types are provided as opaque identifiers for important data:

VariableId
    A unique identifier for each variable in the program. Two variables have
    the same identifier iff they are in fact the same variable. That is,
    variables with the same name, but in different scopes, have different
    VariableIds. There are conversion functions described below that convert
    VariableSymbolNTs or VarRefExps to the variable's VariableId.

ExpressionId
    A unique identifier for each expression in the program. Expressions are
    identified iff they are structurally equivalent, that is, they consist
    of identical operators applied to identical operands. Leaf variables are
    compared as VariableIds are, so two occurrences of  a + b  in the
    program text will get the same ExpressionId iff they refer to the same
    variables a and b.

TypeId
    A unique identifier for each type in the program. Types are identical if
    they are the same basic type or the same class type (i.e., have the same
    definition, structural equivalence does not suffice) or are derived from
    the same basic/class type using exactly the same specifiers and
    modifiers (pointer, const, etc.).

Location
    An abstract "memory region" computed by points-to analysis for every
    program variable and other expression that refers to an object in
    memory, such as a pointer dereference, structure field access, etc. Two
    expressions may be aliases iff they correspond to the same Location;
    conversely, expressions that have different Locations are definitely not
    aliases.
    Points-to analysis must be activated using the --run-pointsto-analysis
    command line flag; otherwise, analyzers trying to access Locations will
    segfault. The analysis is a variant of Steensgaard's flow-insensitive,
    context-insensitive analysis. It works on C programs that are complete,
    i.e., do not call any external functions. Casting and structures are
    supported. Pointer arithmetic is supported as long as each pointer stays
    within one memory region (array).

ContextInfo
    An abstract object representing the current interprocedural analysis
    context. This is meant mainly to be passed to support functions that can
    provide context-sensitive information.

Comparisons for equality and total ordering relations for these types are
provided by SATIrE.


Auxiliary Functions
===================
Auxiliary functions are functions provided by the SATIrE library to support
some common operations that would be impossible or very complicated to
implement in FULA. The definitions for these functions are automatically
linked against the generated analyzer. The declarations below are
automatically included in any analyzer created with SATIrE.

varsym_varid :: VariableSymbolNT -> VariableId;
    maps a variable symbol to its VariableId

varref_varid :: Expression -> VariableId;
    maps a VarRefExp to its VariableId; it is an error to call this with any
    other subtype of Expression!

exprid_expr :: ExpressionId -> Expression;
    maps the expression identifier to the actual expression it represents

    variable introduced by SATIrE (for logical values, function return
    values, etc.)

is_heapvarid :: VariableId -> bool;
    determines whether the variable identifier refers to a heap variable
    introduced by SATIrE's points-to analysis (to name heap allocation
    sites)

varid_str :: VariableId -> str;

    format very similar to PAG's pattern syntax

varid_has_location :: VariableId -> bool;

    determine whether the variable has a location in a given context

exprid_has_location :: ExpressionId -> bool;
exprid_location :: ExpressionId -> Location;
    determine the abstract memory location corresponding to an expression,
    this can be a simple variable reference, but also a pointer dereference
    or other more complex expression; expressions that denote one of
    SATIrE's temporary variables, or expressions that do not denote an
    object in memory (an "lvalue") do not have locations

varid_location_cs :: VariableId, ContextInfo -> Location;
exprid_location_cs :: :: ExpressionId, ContextInfo -> Location;
    context-sensitive variants of points-to support functions; the
    ContextInfo argument must be the current value of the context attribute
    (which is not directly available from support functions and must be
    passed as an argument if needed)

    returns the list of program variables stored in the given location

location_funcsyms :: Location -> *FunctionSymbolNT;
    returns the list of function symbols associated with the given function
    location

    some other location may hold a pointer to it

is_array_location :: Location -> bool;
    determines whether the given location is an array

    to typenumber2 (in the object oriented class hierarchy)

expr_to_exprnum :: Expression -> unum;
    convert an expression to the corresponding expression number, a unique
    integer associated with each lexically distinct expression

exprnum_to_expr :: unum -> Expression;
    convert an expression number to the corresponding expression

    convert an expression number to the corresponding string (of the
    expression)
