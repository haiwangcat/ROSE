BUILDING SATIrE:

* 'make -j' may fail [only 'make' always works]
parallel build with "make -j" does not always work due to some
dependencies on generated files which are not properly represented in
make-files yet. You can use -j, but in case compilation fails,
run 'make clean', and rerun 'make' (without option -j).
