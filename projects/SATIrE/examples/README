Compile all examples in this directory:
sh build-examples.sh

The following examples are created in executable-examples:

constprop  : constant propagation operating on C++
sl1rd      : intra-procedural reaching definitions analysis on the subset SL1 of C++
sl2rd      : inter-procedural reaching definitions analysis on the subset SL2 of C++
srw98_shape: shape analysis as published in TOPLAS'98, "Solving shape-analysis problems
             in languages with destructive updating" by M. Sagiv, T. Reps, R. Wilhelm.
             analysis is adapted to operate on the subset SL3 of C++
             (the only pointer operator accepted is '->', but not '&', '*', or arithmetics)
nnh99_shape: shape analysis as published in "Principle of Program Analysis" by F. Nielson
             H.R. Nielson, C. Hankin
             analysis is adapted to operate on the subset SL3 of C++
             (the only pointer operator accepted is '->', but not '&', '*', or arithmetics)
