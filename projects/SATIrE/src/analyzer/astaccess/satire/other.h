/*
MS 10.5.07: Dummy (empty) file to allow using pagheader.h from PAG's include directory (which includes other.h)
other.h is generated by PAG for a given analysis spec. However, it's an empty file. We need it here to allow building a library.

This may need to be fixed in future, should "other.h" ever contain any code.
