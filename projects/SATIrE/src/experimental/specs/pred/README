1) expressions x<0 and 0>x have different exprnum's. Therefore they are
   handled as different expressions. A normalization of expressions could
   address that.
2) The analysis is a must-analysis. If from two different path an expression
   has t-value true and it does not exist in the other path it must be
   set to t-or-f because the other path may have modified some variable
   used in the expression and thus, the predicate-expression might no longer
   be true (resp. false).

3) Improvements:
   1) collect assignments (as equations)
      x=A, if x in A then x=. (arbitrary)
           if x notin A then x=A;
   2) combine operator loest Menge aller Gleichungen/Ungleichungen auf
      und conservatively combines to new set
