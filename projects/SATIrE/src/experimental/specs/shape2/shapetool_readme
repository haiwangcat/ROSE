SATIrE Shape Analysis Tool 0.2

This tool was created with the SATIrE program analysis framework.
SATIrE is developed by Markus Schordan (2004+), Gergo Barany (2004+), Adrian Prantl (2007+), Viktor Pavlu (2007+).

First, extract the archive with

  tar -xzf shapetool-0.2.tgz

This will create the directory 'shapetool' which contains the program binary.

  cd shapetool
  ./shape --help

To try the shapetool on one of the given testcases, do the following

  ./shape tests/srw98_listreverse.C

This will perform the analysis on the listreverse example. The results of the analysis are shown in the file default.gdl (use the --output-gdl=FILENAME param to change this filename)

When activated with --output-source=FILENAME, the analysis annotates the program source code with the analysis information and writes it back to FILENAME.
