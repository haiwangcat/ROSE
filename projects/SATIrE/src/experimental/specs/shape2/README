The subdirectories contain the specs of these shape analysis algorithms:

nnh99/ The analysis described in the book "Principle of Program Analysis"
       (F. Nielson, H.R. Nielson, C. Hankin).

srw98/ The analysis from TOPLAS'98, "Solving shape-analysis problems
       in languages with destructive updating" (M. Sagiv, T. Reps, R. Wilhelm)

What is common between the analyses, i.e. matching of nested expressions,
normalisation, alias predicates, visualisation, etc. is kept in the
toplevel files named common_* and visualisation.[Ch]. Where these files
need to refer to the specific implementations of their carrier, that is

  nnh99: o_ShapeGraphSetLifted
  srw98: o_ShapeGraphLifted

only {DFI} is written, the Makefile expands this to the name of the carrier
matching the analysis.

Scripts
  analyse          runs srw98 and nnh99 with given arguments

  start-batch      calls start-benchmark with different memory settings and
                   callstring lengths
  start-benchmark  calls measurements with different analysis parameters
                   (graphset/summarygraph, w/o tempvars, w/o common tail)
  measurements     calls srw98 and nnh99 with given arguments for a number
                   of tests in a subdir of tests/

  start-comparison calls measurements-vs with good memory settings and
                   analysis paramter settings that make most sense for a
                   comparison of srw vs. nnh
  measurements-vs  calls srw98 and nnh99 with given arguments for a number
                   of tests in a subdir of tests/
                   srw98 is called to find aliases in the summary graph
                   nnh99 is called to find aliases in the graphset
