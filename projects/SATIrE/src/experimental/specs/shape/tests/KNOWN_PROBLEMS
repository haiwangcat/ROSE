Known problems:
FAIL: test9.C: SgForStatement PAG visualization unparse error
FAIL: wcettests/bubble.c : SgForStatement PAG visualization unparse error

test1a.C: 
  - ICFG: constructor A in constructor B is missing
  - ICFG: destructor B should call destructor A (but it does not)

test1b.C: 
  - ICFG: all calls of default constructors and destructors 
          are represented by external calls but should be represented
          as in test2.C
test2.C : 
  - ICFG: constructor calls are correct
  - ICFG: destructor B should call destructor A (but it does not)

test3.C : more complex test case, all problems as in test1a.C and
          uses static variable
          use option -DOUTPUT when generating an executable for producing output with
          information on constructor/destructor calls

General problem with destructors: all destructors are considered to be
     virtual (generating superfluous edges compared to non-virtual calls)

Fixed problems:
OK: test6.C: unreachable code (CFG test fails, analysis performed anyway)
OK: test8.C: unreachable code (CFG test fails, analysis performed anyway)
