Notes:

Structure of transfer functions:
  Interprocedural:
  ICFG: dfi->dfi, calling temp-creating-functions
                , calling expression

  expression:
  match AST:dfi->dfi, calling functions
  
  High-Level transfer functions: handle special cases, introduce temporaries
  Low-Level transfer functions: as published in SRW'98

------

Special cases such as
- dereference of null-pointer (non-existing pointer value) in
  x.sel = null
  x.sel = new
  x = y.sel
  must be reported to the user-interface
  OR
  should be presented in the analysis as 'bot'

STATUS: not implemented

---

Node ParamAssignment:
Q: Why do we use VariableSymbol and not VarRefExp (why do we use different Syms?)?
A: It is not necessary to generate VarRefExp

---

Q: assign_x_new;x = new; OR new as expression?
A: introduce temporaries in expression processing in PAG (in general)

----

Q:Why do we need the blue blocks? (bb_intern?)
A:this is a bug; will be removed

Q: Should dereferencing null return a special value?
A: This requires a better user-interface. Not done yet.

TODO:
* elimination of argument-vars
* explicit handling of null-value
* condition sensitive
