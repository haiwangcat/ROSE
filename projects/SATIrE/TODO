* ICFG Builder (2011):
1) Support for array initializers
   - currently they are ignored (we would need to generate a list of
     assignments or a special construct accessible in a specification)
2) Support for initialization of global variables
   - currently global variables show up in the ICFG, but the initialization
     in global scope is not accessible. Thus, global variables do not
     have a corresponding DeclStatement
3) In cases where all previous branches exit with return, Join-Nodes are generated without ingoing edges. Those are not incorrect, but superfluous. Those nodes will be cleaned up at some point.

* Annotation Mechanism (2012):
1) Annotation of analysis results as pragmas
   - currently only comments are annotated

* Warning: Decprecated Headers (2012):
1) analyzer/astnumbering/satire/EqualityTraversal.h uses <ext/hash_map>
   We will probably replace this with include<unordered_map>, but this
   requires additional work.

* Warning: Linking static lib with dynamic libs (2012):
1) Libraries built from PAG analyzers are compiled as static libs. Those are linked with the dynamic SATIrE libs. This works but should be fixed because it is not portable.
