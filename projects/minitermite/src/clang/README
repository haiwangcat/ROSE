========================================================================
PRELIMINARY CLANG FRONTEND FOR SATIrE
========================================================================

(C) 2008 Adrian Prantl <adrian@complang.tuwien.ac.at>

Basic Idea:

The clang[1] frontend was extended by a "-emit-term" command line
option that builds an AST and exports it in the TERMITE format. This
can then be read in by the termparser to create a ROSE AST and
subsequently an SATIrE ICFG. It can be seen as an immature replacement
for the proprietary EDG frontend.
