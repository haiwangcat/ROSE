.SH About
.sp
Minitermite is a light\-weight library that transforms C, C++, and
Fortran programs into a term\-based representation of their abstract
syntax trees (AST) and vice versa.
.SH Related work, Provenance
.sp
Minitermite is a spin\-off (friendly fork) of Termite [1] which is
distributed as part of the SATIrE program analysis framework [2] from
the Computer Languages group at Vienna University of Technology,
Austria.

.SH Authors
.sp
The corresponding author and maintainer is Adrian Prantl. The original
Termite was based on an earlier prototype by Christoph Bonitz and
Markus Schordan.  Gergo Barany contributed the term_lint grammar
checker, as well as support for the ICFG and other PAG\-based analyses
and numerous bug fixes and improvements. Several testcases were
contributed by Viktor Pavlu. The majority of the Clang front\-end
integration was contributed by Dietmar Ebner with some help from
Florian Brandner.
