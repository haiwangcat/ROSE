 *  
 *  
 * <h2>About</h2>
 *  
 * Minitermite is a light-weight library that transforms C, C++, and
 * Fortran programs into a term-based representation of their abstract
 * syntax trees (AST) and vice versa.
 *  
 * <h2>Related work, Provenance</h2>
 *  
 * Minitermite is a spin-off (friendly fork) of Termite
 * (http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/adrian/termite) which is
 * distributed as part of the SATIrE program analysis framework
 * (http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/satire/) from
 * the Computer Languages group at Vienna University of Technology,
 * Austria.
 *  
 * <h2>Authors</h2>
 *  
 * The corresponding author and maintainer is Adrian Prantl. The original
 * Termite was based on an earlier prototype by Christoph Bonitz and
 * Markus Schordan.  Gergo Barany contributed the term_lint grammar
 * checker, as well as support for the ICFG and other PAG-based analyses
 * and numerous bug fixes and improvements. Several testcases were
 * contributed by Viktor Pavlu. The majority of the Clang front-end
 * integration was contributed by Dietmar Ebner with some help from
 * Florian Brandner.
 *  
 * <h2>Installation instructions</h2>
 *  
 * The following commands should do the job on a UNIX-like system::
 * <pre> 
 *     mkdir build && cd build
 *     ../configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-rosedir=/opt/rose --with-boostdir=/usr --with-swi-prolog=no
 *     make -j<N> install
 *     make installcheck
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h2>Dependencies</h2>
 *  
 * ROSE: http://www.rosecompiler.org/
 * flex, yacc, boost
 *  
 * Optional: swi-prolog, clang, doxygen
 *  
 * <h2>License</h2>
 *  
 * Just like SATIrE, minitermite is distributed under a permissive
 * three-clause BSD license. See COPYING for details.
 * termlint.pl is covered by the GPLv3.
